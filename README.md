## How to use it

Shift is entirely web based, to access it you can go to: https://combjellly.github.io/shift/

The syntax borrows heavily from python & javascript.

In short, there are Every loops that look like this

``` every 20 ```

These every loops can be seen as a timing mechanism that executes any code below every X number of beat. 

so in this example

```
every 20
  play.Piano
```

Piano will play every 20 beats.
